# diabetes-prediction-using-ML-DL
This repository contains machine learning and deep learning models for predicting the onset of diabetes in patients. The models used include Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Ensemble Learning, Adaptive Boosting, and Deep Neural Networks. The performance of the models is compared, and the best performing model is identified.
